WebSecProbe is designed to perform a series of HTTP requests to a target URL with various payloads in order to test for potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

- It takes user input for the target URL and the path.
- It defines a list of payloads that represent different HTTP request variations, such as URL-encoded characters, special headers, and different HTTP methods.
- It iterates through each payload and constructs a full URL by appending the payload to the target URL.
- For each constructed URL, it sends an HTTP GET request using the requests library, and it captures the response status code and content length.
- It prints the constructed URL, status code, and content length for each request, effectively showing the results of each variation's response from the target server.
- After testing all payloads, it queries the Wayback Machine (a web archive) to check if there are any archived snapshots of the target URL/path. If available, it prints the closest archived snapshot's information.

> Does This Tool Bypass 403 ?

> It doesn't directly attempt to bypass a 403 Forbidden status code. The code's purpose is more about testing the behavior of the server when different requests are made, including requests with various payloads, headers, and URL variations. While some of the payloads and headers in the code might be used in certain scenarios to test for potential security misconfigurations or weaknesses, it doesn't guarantee that it will bypass a 403 Forbidden status code.

> In summary, this code is a tool for exploring and analyzing a web server's responses to different requests, but whether or not it can bypass a 403 Forbidden status code depends on the specific configuration and security measures implemented by the target server.

  - **Whitespace at the Beginning (" " + self.path):**
    - Whitespace added at the beginning of the path.

  - **Path with Semicolon (;):**
    - Semicolon added before and after the path.

  - **Path with Extra Slashes:**
    - Test for bypassing by adding extra slashes (e.g., //path).

  - **Path with URL-encoded Slash:**
    - Use URL-encoded slash to bypass (e.g., %2Fpath).

  - **Path with Double URL-encoded Slash:**
    - Use double URL-encoded slash (e.g., %252Fpath).

  - **Path with Path Parameter:**
    - Add a path parameter (e.g., /path;parameter).

  - **Path with Query Parameter in Path:**
    - Add a query parameter within the path (e.g., /path?parameter).

  - **Path with Additional Dots:**
    - Add additional dots in the path (e.g., /path/../path).

  - **Path with Unicode Encoding:**
    - Use Unicode encoding to represent characters (e.g., %u002Fpath).

  - **Path with Double URL-encoded Dot:**
    - Use double URL-encoded dot (e.g., %252E).

  - **Path with URL-encoded Null Byte:**
